		<p>"Remnant: From the Ashes delivers a beautifully deranged vision of the apocalypse overflowing with twisted creatures hellbent on making you suffer. The thrill of finally beating a boss that’s had your number for hours is right up there with the Souls games that so clearly inspired it, though the underwhelming gear system sometimes brings down the high of overcoming the frequent difficulty spikes. Overall it’s a solid game that offers one of the best and most rewarding co-op experiences in quite some time, as long as you have a hint of desire to challenge and punish yourself over and over." - David Jagneaux, IGN</p>
		
		<p>"I've been waiting for a game like this, something that captures the fun of co-op in dark souls with your friends. Add on top of that interesting lore logs, surprisingly strong shooting elements and a cool aesthetic to its armor and weapons this game is a surefire favorite of mine." - Kreet, Metacritic</p>
		
		<p>"At a glance, Remnant: From the Ashes looks like it was coughed out by a game development algorithm. It’s a third-person looter-shooter and a Dark Souls-inspired boss rush, with an emphasis on co-op and a dynamically generated campaign. Stylistically it's inspired by fantasy, science fiction, Westerns, post-apocalyptic worlds like Fallout and Gears of War, and various kinds of horror fiction, most notably the SCP Foundation. Even the title reads like it was generated by a Twitter bot.

		I was apprehensive going in, but was surprised by how much I enjoyed Remnant. It’s a bizarre game, and it's completely shameless in how it assembles borrowed concepts, but like a wasteland vehicle from a Mad Max film, it works." - Rick Lane, PCGamer</p>
