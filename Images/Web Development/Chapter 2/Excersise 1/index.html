	<h3>Plot Summary</h3>
	<div id="Plot">
		<p>Remnant: From the Ashes takes place in a post-apocalyptic Earth that has been devastated and overrun by an interdimensional evil called the Root. The player is a wandering survivor of the apocalypse driven to put an end to the Root by traveling to a tower on an island that appears to be the epicenter of the invasion. Early in their journey they are brought to Ward 13, an underground bunker where human survivors live.The player is tasked with finding Ward 13's founder, Ford, and explores the devastated Earth city before finding a portal to an interdimensional rift known as the Labyrinth, allowing them to travel between worlds in search of Ford.
		The player first travels to Rhom, the deserted remains of a once great civilization that destroyed its world to save itself from the Root. They unlock a monolithic tower in which the former ruler of Rhom, the Undying King, tasks the player with tra veling to the swamp planet of Corsus to kill its Guardian - a being that protects the planet from invasive forces such as the Root - and bring him its heart in exchange for pointing the player in Ford's direction. On Corsus, the player kills the Guardian and is given the choice of delivering the heart to the King, or giving it to the Iskal Queen, the ruler of a parasitic insectoid hive mind that has taken over the planet's former inhabitants. If the player chooses the latter, they are forced to kill the King before proceeding

		The player then travels to the forest world of Yaesha, where they encounter a civil war between its Satyr-like inhabitants and befriend a group of rebels. After some exploration, they find Ford imprisoned and free him. In exchange, Ford gives the player a key to activate a portal deep within Ward 13 that allows them to travel to the tower, which was formerly the humans' Ward 17.

		In Ward 13, the player can find information revealing that the Root were brought to Earth due to a failed series of experiments using the human subconscious as gateways to other worlds; the Root themselves are linked to one of their subjects, known as Dreamers. The player travels to Ward 17 through the portal and encounters the Dreamer, whom they battle and defeat within his own subconscious. The Dreamer transforms into a massive Root creature, which the player finally kills, releasing them from the Dreamer's subconscious and killing the Root at their source once and for all.</p>

	  <h3>Game Reviews</h3>
		<p>"Remnant: From the Ashes delivers a beautifully deranged vision of the apocalypse overflowing with twisted creatures hellbent on making you suffer. The thrill of finally beating a boss that’s had your number for hours is right up there with the Souls games that so clearly inspired it, though the underwhelming gear system sometimes brings down the high of overcoming the frequent difficulty spikes. Overall it’s a solid game that offers one of the best and most rewarding co-op experiences in quite some time, as long as you have a hint of desire to challenge and punish yourself over and over." - David Jagneaux, IGN</p>
		
		<p>"I've been waiting for a game like this, something that captures the fun of co-op in dark souls with your friends. Add on top of that interesting lore logs, surprisingly strong shooting elements and a cool aesthetic to its armor and weapons this game is a surefire favorite of mine." - Kreet, Metacritic</p>
		
		<p>"At a glance, Remnant: From the Ashes looks like it was coughed out by a game development algorithm. It’s a third-person looter-shooter and a Dark Souls-inspired boss rush, with an emphasis on co-op and a dynamically generated campaign. Stylistically it's inspired by fantasy, science fiction, Westerns, post-apocalyptic worlds like Fallout and Gears of War, and various kinds of horror fiction, most notably the SCP Foundation. Even the title reads like it was generated by a Twitter bot.

		I was apprehensive going in, but was surprised by how much I enjoyed Remnant. It’s a bizarre game, and it's completely shameless in how it assembles borrowed concepts, but like a wasteland vehicle from a Mad Max film, it works." - Rick Lane, PCGamer</p>
