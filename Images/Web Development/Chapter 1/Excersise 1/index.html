		<!--Crêpe descrition in a paragraph-->
		<p>A crêpe is essentially a French pancake made of thinly spread batter containing flour, eggs, butter, milk, salt, water. And just like how pancakes can be served with syrups or melted chocolate, crepes are the same. In fact, it's even better with honey and fresh sliced fruit.</p>

		<!--Step by step instructions in an ordered list-->
		<ol>
			<li>Whisk flour and eggs together in a large mixing bowl; gradually add in milk and water, stirring to combine. Add salt and melted butter; beat until smooth. </li>
			<li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 50g for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly. </li>
			<li>Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more.</li>
			<li>Plate it up with or without condiments and enjoy!</li>
